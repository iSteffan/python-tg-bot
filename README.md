# python-tg-bot

Redirect/filtering messages from public group to your own

This bot monitors the public group https://t.me/.... Messages are filtered based on specified
criteria and forwarded to a new group. This way, you don't have to keep an eye on every message â€”
only the ones that matter to you will be delivered.

To run: type in the terminal "python palace_bot.py"
